## THIS IS MY CYBER SEC REPO
Here I will be uploading scripts, tools and anything that I find interesting.
I will also upload writeups for CTFs.

## arp_poison.py
This is a simple script to perform an ARP poison attack.
Usage:
``` python3 arp_poison.py [gateway_ip] [target_ip] [packet_count] [iface]```

## make_wordlist_to_file_wordlist.py
This is a tool for looking files on API endpoints.
It takes a host and a wordlist to use(to that wordlist it will append a format at the end of each word), you can add more formats in the extension_list variable, by default it will use '.php', '.py', '.html', '.txt'.
More functionalitpython3 file.py target wordlistPath -Nf (for showing also 404)"y coming soon...
Usage:
```python3 file.py target wordlistPath -Nf (for showing also 404)"```
(You can also do a -h to ask for help ;) )
